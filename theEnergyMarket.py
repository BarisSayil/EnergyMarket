	#INTRODUCTION
	#This is a simulation of an energy market using concurrent execution features of Python. There are 4 kinds of processes: Market, Home, Weather, External.

	#This can be thought of as a small village. There can a a single home or 10 or anywhere between. More than 10 home is also possible but since my computer isn't very powerful I didn't try it.
	#All homes have an energy comsumption per day. This doesn't change. Some homes also have a small nuclear reactor that produces some energy for them, this is also constant.
	#If homes produce less energy than they produce, they try to get some energy for free and if that fails they buy it on the market.
	#Some homes are generous and will try to give their surplus of energy, others will sell any surplus immediately.
	
	#The climate here is constant and the temperature changes little. There are sunny and cloudy days.

	#There are some external events that occur as well. For instance every day there's a a very small chance that a breakthrough in nuclear fusion will be developped. Also a sightly bigger
	#chance that Macron will increase the tax on energy.

	#Market manages everything that happens. If a home wants to buy/sell energy it will tell it the price. Each day it updates the price according to external and internal factors such as temperature and 
	#a increase on the price of energy. It also syncronizes all the other processes. Each day it waits until Weather and External are done, then deals with all the homes. After a day is over it tells
	#all other processes that they can proceed to the next day.

	#There is also the option to have some visualization. Check the run() method of Market class for more info.



	# Two shared states that are handled by the weather process. Even though in general shared states need synchronization, multiprocessing.Value is automatically 
	# synchronized by Python so that race conditions do not occur. In other words, temperature and sunny are process and thread-safe.

	sunny=Value('i', 1)  					# It's a wrapper for whether it's sunny or cloudy. 1: sunny, 10: cloudy
	

	# We instantiate all the processes we want in the simulation:
	weather=Weather()						# No arguments.

	market=Market(10)							# Market takes the number of homes as an argument. However, by default there are 5 homes so if that is the number of homes desired, it can be left out.
											# If more or less homes is desired put it as an argument, e.g., for a single home write Market(1)

	home1=Home(10, 5, True)					# Homes take the arguments consumptionRate, productionRate, and isGenerous.
	home2=Home(10, 11, True)
