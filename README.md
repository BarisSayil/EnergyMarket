# EnergyMarket
It simulates a simple energy market using concurrent execution features of Python.

Now we have: Home --Message Queues-- Market --Shared Memory-- Weather


Stuff to do:

Add Home2 (IPC with Market) (Almost works... ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Nothing' )

Add IPC between Home1 and Home2
